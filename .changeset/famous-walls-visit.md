Components `<DefaultResultListItem>`, `<SearchBar>` (including `<SearchBarBase>`), `<SearchFilter>` (including `.Checkbox`, `.Select`, and `.Autocomplete` static prop components), `<SearchResult>`, and `<SearchResultPager>` are now exported from `@backstage/plugin-search-react`. They are now deprecated in `@backstage/plugin-search` and will be removed in a future release.
