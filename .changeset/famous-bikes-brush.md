'@backstage/core-plugin-api': patch
---

Introduced a new experimental feature that allows you to declare plugin-wide options for your plugin by defining
`__experimentalConfigure` in your `createPlugin` options. See https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/customization.md for more information.

This is an experimental feature and it will have breaking changes in the future.
